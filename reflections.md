Visualization of sound, 15 seconds per line.

>There was only one spring tone in the first time, and a spring tone and a rising tone appeared in the second time. The third rising tone became sharper, the fourth time slightly decreased, and the fifth time picked up.

A very low buzzer sound starts playing about every 6 seconds. This keeps repeating through the entire piece.

>The sound of an explosion appeared for the sixth time, and the sound of the seventh explosion strengthened, and then continued to strengthen.

at 0:21 a crushed spring sound starts. Very Nine Inch Nails in the compression of it. This sound repeats at the same frequency as the low buzzer did, now taking it over entirely. The pitch seems to be operated with noise.

The sound continues to grow, the reverb holding for longer, and getting louder every repeat.

>About one minute, sound of continuous blasting. After a pause, the continuous blasting again produced a huge noise.

>At the end are the echoes of the blast and fragmented noise.

At 0:58, the sound starts running continuously, and louder than before, the pitch is randomized each time the sound is triggered it seems.

There is a pause in the blast, but it is harder to notice because of the amount of echo and reverb that is on the sound. It almost carries over completely.

The sound continues until  ~1:04 where it rails off, and the buzzer can be heard a final time. The trailing off is like an echo fading off in the distance.
