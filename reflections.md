From the beginning of this piece reminds me of a Prodigy song I can't seem to put my finger on.  The repeated bang (0:02), starts to sound like a common output from 3rd party oscillators and tends to create an odd sounding tempo.  Would be nice to see what it would be like to cut that tempo every so often.

The increased treble (0:40) livens up the piece, as a play with sounds get more dramatic and back and forth (like long wobbles), takes place thereafter.  This is nice.

I am particularly fond of the ending (1:17), a sharp and dramatic end the cuts the wobbles, repeated bang, and laser sounds, resulting in a beautiful bass-rich end.

## Amendments

Changed macro oscillator's frequency knob to full giving a more digital beep sound similar to the sounds of a drunken R2D2.

>## Mixer Info

>The mixer allows for panning between right and left channels with the pan knob, as well as solo and muting of any of the input channels with the S and M buttons respectively.

>Mix Number | Function
>--- | ---
>Mix 1 | Quiet percussive sound, raspy rising sound is prominent.
>Mix 2 | Very deep, echoing percussive sound.
>Mix 3 | Noise on beat, for giving the percussion a little more dirt.
>Mix 4 | A echoing, warbling percussion sound, with a slight splash to it. Changes volume drastically..
>Mix 5 | The melodic lead section.
>Mix 6 | Drone bass section.

>The entire score can be played just by adjusting the mixer, but great things come from experimentation.

>## Stage 1
>The first stage will start with a simpler beat, and the melodic lead part. The lead should have some amount of filter applied to it, to make it more subdued. As the part goes on, add more of the percussive sounds from the first 4 channels, mixing them together to find their sound.

>This stage should last for about a third of the piece.

>## Stage 2
>This stage is about the lead section. Bring it to the front, and adjust the filter accordingly to bring it to a more aggressive state. Lower the percussion sounds so they fall into the background and let the lead breathe. Change the sounds coming from it, and find its place in the mixture.

>This stage should last for a little over a third of the piece.

>## Stage 3
>Integrate the drone bass into the track now, use it to fill out the track, and bring the level of the percussion up. Keep pushing the percussion until it takes over most of the track. When nearing the end of the track, cut all sound but the drone bass. Keep that going for a bit, cut the bass out as well.

>This stage should last for the remainder of the piece. With the single drone bass taking up roughly 5-10 seconds of a 90 second recording

>Congratulations, the track is complete.
