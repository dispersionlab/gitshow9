>## Mixer Info

>The mixer allows for panning between right and left channels with the pan knob, as well as solo and muting of any of the input channels with the S and M buttons respectively.

>Mix Number | Function
--- | ---
Mix 1 | Quiet percussive sound, raspy rising sound is prominent.
Mix 2 | Very deep, echoing percussive sound.
Mix 3 | Noise on beat, for giving the percussion a little more dirt.
Mix 4 | A echoing, warbling percussion sound, with a slight splash to it. Changes volume drastically..
Mix 5 | The melodic lead section.
Mix 6 | Drone bass section.

>The entire score can be played just by adjusting the mixer, but great things come from experimentation.

>## Stage 1
>The first stage will start with a simpler beat, and the melodic lead part. The lead should have some amount of filter applied to it, to make it more subdued. As the part goes on, add more of the percussive sounds from the first 4 channels, mixing them together to find their sound.

>This stage should last for about a third of the piece.

>## Stage 2
>This stage is about the lead section. Bring it to the front, and adjust the filter accordingly to bring it to a more aggressive state. Lower the percussion sounds so they fall into the background and let the lead breathe. Change the sounds coming from it, and find its place in the mixture.

>This stage should last for a little over a third of the piece.

>## Stage 3
>Integrate the drone bass into the track now, use it to fill out the track, and bring the level of the percussion up. Keep pushing the percussion until it takes over most of the track. When nearing the end of the track, cut all sound but the drone bass. Keep that going for a bit, cut the bass out as well.

>This stage should last for the remainder of the piece. With the single drone bass taking up roughly 5-10 seconds of a 90 second recording

>Congratulations, the track is complete.

In the recording the sound of a melody fades in and is followed by a unclear percussive sound which gets stronger slowly until ~20 where it becomes completely clear. Melody continues along with the percussive sound. At about 00:39, as it was mentioned in the score the track enters an aggressive state which is interesting. The aggressive mixture of sounds keeps playing until they all suddenly stop and the quiet percussive sound leads us to the end of the track. The sudden stop of the tense loud repetitive sounds and bringing the listener to an almost perfect silence was a very impressive ending for me!

In terms of playing the score, I honestly wasn't able to play the same track which was in the recording as it was not explicitly explained what knob should be changed during the track. I played with mixer knobs and input channels but it never ended up imitating the sounds I was listening to from recording.
