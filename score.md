## Mixer Info

The mixer allows for panning between right and left channels with the pan knob, as well as solo and muting of any of the input channels with the S and M buttons respectively.

Mix Number | Function
--- | ---
Mix 1 | Quiet percussive sound, raspy rising sound is prominent.
Mix 2 | Very deep, echoing percussive sound.
Mix 3 | Noise on beat, for giving the percussion a little more dirt.
Mix 4 | A echoing, warbling percussion sound, with a slight splash to it. Changes volume drastically, be careful with the levels on this.
Mix 5 | The melodic lead section.
Mix 6 | Drone bass section.

The entire score can be played just by adjusting the mixer, but great things come from experimentation.

## Stage 1
In the first stage of the piece, experiment and play with the beat, and the rhythm. Use the clock to change the tempo and find your speed with it. The rate on the 3rd random module will allow for significant adjustment of the percussion as well.

## Stage 2
This stage is about the lead section. Bring it into play by adjusting the mix. The frequency is random, but you can control roughly where it will land. Adjust the frequency CV and the drive on the filter to suit. Change the key it is being quantized in.

## Stage 3
Integrate the drone bass into the track now, use it to fill out the track, and bring the level of the percussion up. Keep pushing the percussion until it takes over most of the track. When nearing the end of the track, cut all sound but the drone bass. Keep that going for a bit, then cut that as well.
