## Mixer Info

The mixer allows for panning between right and left channels with the pan knob, as well as solo and muting of any of the input channels with the S and M buttons respectively.

Mix Number | Function
--- | ---
Mix 1 | Quiet percussive sound, raspy rising sound is prominent.
Mix 2 | Very deep, echoing percussive sound.
Mix 3 | Noise on beat, for giving the percussion a little more dirt.
Mix 4 | A echoing, warbling percussion sound, with a slight splash to it. Changes volume drastically..
Mix 5 | The melodic lead section.
Mix 6 | Drone bass section.

The entire score can be played just by adjusting the mixer, but great things come from experimentation.

##Stage 1
In this stage, a first setup of percussion was chosen with playing with pan and volume of the first 4 knobs of the mixer and the volume of the lead melody (mixer 5) was reduced to have more emphasis on the percussion part. As song progresses, we increase the volume of mixer 3 and 4 and reduce the volume of mixer 1 and 2.

## Stage 2

In this section, percussion mixers (i.e., 1-4) were given a less volume dominance and volume of the mixer 5 as the lead was increased. Meanwhile, pan and also frequency of its input was being changed to give us some variation of the lead melody.

## Stage 3

This stage, explores less volume of the lead melody and volumes of mixer 1-4 and 6 (drone bass) was increased. Along that, the pan knob of these mixers were being changed and at right about the last 10 seconds of this stage all the percussions of mixer 1-4 were turned off and you can only hear the sound of mixer 6.
